                <h2>Project Brief</h2>
                <p>
                This project analyzes movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime, focusing on director,
                category, rating, and release-year trends. It explores which directors are most
                prominent by type (movie vs TV show) and which categories dominate by count and rating.
                Using a data-visualization approach, we track quality over time by rating and release year.
                The goal is to provide insights for creators, marketers, and viewers to make informed
                decisions based on data.

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    With a vast catalog and changing audience preferences, Amazon Prime requires
                    data-driven decisions. This analysis supports content planning, audience
                    understanding, and competitive benchmarking by revealing what performs well,
                    when, and why—ultimately guiding strategy for creators, studios, and marketers.
