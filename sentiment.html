        <h1>Sentiment-Driven Product Recommendation</h1>
        <p>
        This project leverages <strong>NLP (TextBlob + TF-IDF)</strong> to analyze customer reviews
        and generate product recommendations. It uses a <strong>Flask API</strong> as backend and an
        interactive <strong>Chart.js/D3.js dashboard</strong> for data visualization.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Visualize sentiment distribution of reviews</li>
        <li>Backend API built with Flask</li>
        <li>NLP pipeline with TextBlob & TF-IDF</li>
        <li>Interactive charts with Chart.js and D3.js</li>

            This project utilizes how sentiment analysis can enhance product recommendations and sales insights within e-commerce platforms. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques—including text preprocessing, feature engineering, and TF-IDF vectorization—to Amazon product reviews to develop a sentiment-driven recommendation system. Supervised machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are used to classify user reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
            The technology provides important data, including sentiment distribution, price-performance analysis, rating trends, and review patterns across product categories on an interactive visualization dashboard, in addition to producing individualized product suggestions. This two-pronged strategy helps customers and organizations to make more informed decisions by combining structured product criteria with unstructured user feedback.

            Experimental results demonstrate that Logistic Regression achieved the best 
            performance with an accuracy of 90.15% and an F1-score of 0.9008, outperforming Naïve 
            Bayes (70.27%, 0.6416) and SVM (87.71%, 0.8745). These results confirm that real-time 
            visualization and interpretable machine learning models work well together to turn user
            generated content into actionable intelligence for more intelligent e-commerce tactics.
